Simplex and Interior Point Methods

mod, run and dat files. Perform Benders algorithm using Master and Subproblem. In each cut we add a new constriction to reduce the dimension of master's problem.

In folder dantzig the dantzig cutting plane method is performed. We evaluate cuts to find the optimum. Apply lagrangian duality in P.L problems
